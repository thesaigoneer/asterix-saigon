# asterix-saigon
Archived repo

Asterix-Saigon was my take on a composable KDE, made by Universal Blue and based on Fedora. 

In the end it didn't add that much to existing solutions. 

It now lives on at https://codeberg.org/thesaigoneer/asterix-saigon, as a lean KDE built on top of NixOS.

Check it out.
